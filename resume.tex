%FeedLearn: Microlearning in Facebook Feeds\\ %\hfill \textsl{Stanford HCI group, ongoing} \\
%\vspace{-3mm}
%\begin{compactitem}
\textit{FeedLearn: Microlearning in Facebook Feeds}\\
FeedLearn helps you learn vocabulary as you browse your Facebook feed, by inserting interactive quizzes which you can answer without leaving your feed. User studies show increased vocabulary retention and engagement with quizzes, compared to the email and link approaches used by Duolingo.

%\end{compactitem}
\vspace{-2mm}

\textit{QuizCram: Question-Driven Video Viewing}\\ %\hfill \textsl{Microsoft Research, 2014} \\
QuizCram is a viewer for MOOC lectures that enables quiz-driven video navigation and reviewing. Materials can be generated from existing in-video quizzes on Coursera. User studies show improved engagement with quizzes, increased reviewing, and improved test scores compared to Coursera's in-video quiz format.

\textbf{MIT UID Group -- Undergraduate/MEng research}. Led the following projects: \hfill \textsl{Fall 2011 -- Spring 2013}

\vspace{-2mm}

\textit{Smart Subtitles for Foreign Language Learning}\\ %\hfill \textsl{MIT CSAIL, UID group, 2013} \\ %\hfill \textsl{Spring 2012 -- Spring 2013} \\
Smart Subtitles helps you learn vocabulary while you watch foreign-language videos. It features an interactive transcript with mouse-over definitions and dialog-based navigation. User studies show increased vocabulary learning and increased satisfaction compared to bilingual subtitles.

\vspace{-2mm}

%Full Paper at CHI 2014 (see publications section).\\
\textit{GrammarVis: Visualizing the Grammar of Foreign Languages}\\ %\hfill \textsl{MIT CSAIL, UID group, 2013} \\
GrammarVis lets users interactively explore the syntactic structure of sentences.

\vspace{-2mm}

%I built it as part of a foreign-language manga reader application.\\
%Developing a service that helps students learn vocabulary while watching foreign-language videos.
%It does so with ``smart subtitles'', which are transcripts annotated with information personalized to learners' proficiency levels, to help them understand new vocabulary in the dialog. %by providing user-customized annotations on subtitles for foreign
%\textit{To appear at the CHI 2013 Student Research Competition -- see Publications.}
\textit{ScreenMatch: Visual Context for Software Translators}\\ %\hfill \textsl{MIT CSAIL, UID group, 2012} \\  %\hfill \textsl{Fall 2011}\\
%Software translators lack visual context which illustrates how the strings they are translating are used.\\
ScreenMatch matches translatable strings to screenshots, to illustrate how they are used in the software.

%Developed a software internationalization tool which associates the translatable strings in an application with screenshots in which they appear (using OCR). By presenting a screenshot highlighting how the string is being used, this additional context allows translators to make more accurate translations.
%\textit{Presented at the CHI 2012 Student Research Competition, where it won first place -- see Publications.}

%\vspace{-4.5mm}

%\textbf{MIT Media Lab -- Affective Computing Group} \hfill \textsl{Spring 2009 -- Spring 2011}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Developed a system to conduct mock interviews and highlight areas for improvement. I built the audio-related parts of the backend code and prototyped ways to visualize the speech transcript.
%\item Worked on a system to conduct mock interviews and highlight areas for improvement. I developed the audio-related parts of the backend code - for example, capturing the audio, detecting pauses, segmenting responses, and transcribing the speech. I also prototyped various ways to visualize the speech transcript.
%\item Created a library to allow scripts for the Praat acoustic analysis application to be programatically used with real-time, continuous streams of speech.
%\item Trained a classifier to determine mental states based on displacements of facial features, and used it in a demo application which performed real-time mental state classification.
%\end{itemize}

%\textbf{MIT CSAIL -- T-Party Project} \hfill \textsl{September -- December 2008}\\
%Implemented applications and user interfaces which seamlessly accumulate and present various forms of remotely-stored data on mobile Linux devices. The applications auto-configure and transparently utilize nearby networked peripherals such as external displays and audio devices.

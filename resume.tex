\section{\mysidestyle Work\\Experience}

\textbf{Google -- Software Engineering Intern} \hfill \textsl{June -- August 2011}\\
Developed a comment quality scoring model for use on Android Marketplace application reviews.
In user tests I conducted in several languages, the review ordering produced by this algorithm
was preferred over the existing one, and is thus currently being used in production.

\textbf{Microsoft Corporation -- Software Development Engineer Intern} \hfill \textsl{June -- August 2010}\\
Designed and implemented the Intellisense API, refactoring options, and Visual Studio code completion plugin for a new programming language which is under development by the Technical Computing group.

\textbf{Google Summer of Code 2009 -- FFmpeg} \hfill \textsl{May -- August 2009}\\
Designed and implemented a playlist and concatenation API, parsers for several playlist formats, and a transitional interface for existing applications, for the FFmpeg audio and video transcoder and library. This work was done as part of Google's Summer of Code program.

\section{\mysidestyle Research}

\textbf{MIT CSAIL -- User Interface Design Group} \hfill \textsl{September 2011 -- current}\\
Developing a software internationalization tool which associates the translatable strings in an application with screenshots in which they appear. By presenting a screenshot highlighting how the string is being used, this additional context will allow translators to make more accurate translations.

\textbf{MIT Media Lab -- Affective Computing Group} \hfill \textsl{February -- December 2009}\\
Trained a Bayesian network classifier to determine mental states from a still image or from a video stream based on displacements of facial features, and used it in a demo application which performed mental state classification in real-time from a webcam source.
Also created a library to allow scripts for the Praat acoustic analysis application to be programatically used with real-time, continuous streams of speech.

\textbf{MIT CSAIL -- T-Party Project} \hfill \textsl{September -- December 2008}\\
Implemented applications and user interfaces which seamlessly accumulate and present various forms of remotely-stored data on mobile Linux devices. The applications auto-configure and transparently utilize nearby networked peripherals such as external displays and audio devices.

\section{\mysidestyle Open-source\\Projects}

\textbf{UNetbootin (LiveUSB creator)} \hfill \textsl{January 2007 -- present}\\
Created UNetbootin, a cross-platform utility to create bootable USB flash drives or perform network installations for a wide variety (50+) of Linux distributions. This work has been accepted into the official package repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Gentoo, and other major distributions. \\
\emph{15 million downloads,} \url{http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/}

\textbf{Wubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer)} \hfill \textsl{November 2006 -- August 2007}\\
Designed and implemented the early versions of the Windows-based Ubuntu Installer, which allows Windows users to safely install Ubuntu Linux without repartitioning their hard drives. Formerly an independent project, this work is now part of Ubuntu. \\
\emph{Ships on the official Ubuntu CD,} \url{http://wubi.sourceforge.net/}

\section{\mysidestyle Teaching}

\textbf{Co-Instructor for Introduction to C++ IAP Course at MIT} \hfill \textsl{January 2011}\\
Taught an introductory C++ programming course for MIT students, giving lectures, reviewing assignments, and assisting students with software labs. Also helped archive the course on MIT's OpenCourseWare site:\\
\url{http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011}

%\section{\mysidestyle Programming}

%Used C\#, C++ and C on large-scale production codebases (listed above). Experienced with Java and Python from independent projects and coursework.

\section{\mysidestyle Distinctions}

1$^{\textrm{st}}$ place, Maslab 2010 (an autonomous robotics competition at MIT). \\
Member of the Tau Beta Pi (TBP) and Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) Engineering Honor Societies.

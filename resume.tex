\textbf{Lilt} -- Senior Research Scientist, San Francisco \hfill \textsl{2019 -- now}\\

\vspace{-7mm}

I lead the HCI research group at Lilt, a human-in-the-loop machine translation startup.

\begin{compactitem}
\item Improved the speed of Lilt's interactive machine translation system by shifting computation client-side and using heuristics to reuse computations.
\item Ran user studies to evaluate where translators spend their time during translation, and identify features of translator behaviors that predict better performance.
\item Ran large-scale A/B tests to evaluate the return-on-investment of translating websites, and developed a system to recommend which pages should be translated to which languages.
\end{compactitem}

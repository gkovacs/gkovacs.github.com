                                    Research

   MIT CSAIL - User Interface Design Group
     * Smart Subtitles for Foreign Language Learning Spring 2012 - Spring
       2013
       Developing a service that helps students learn vocabulary while
       watching foreign-language videos. It does so with ``smart
       subtitles'', which are transcripts annotated with information
       personalized to learners' proficiency levels, to help them
       understand new vocabulary in the dialog.
     * Providing Context to Software Translators by Displaying Screenshots
       Fall 2011
       Developed a software internationalization tool which associates the
       translatable strings in an application with screenshots in which
       they appear (using OCR). By presenting a screenshot highlighting
       how the string is being used, this additional context allows
       translators to make more accurate translations.

   MIT Media Lab - Affective Computing Group Spring 2009 - Spring 2011
     * Worked on a system to conduct mock interviews and highlight areas
       for improvement. I developed the audio-related parts of the backend
       code - for example, capturing the audio, detecting pauses,
       segmenting responses, and transcribing the speech. I also
       prototyped various ways to visualize the speech transcript.
     * Created a library to allow scripts for the Praat acoustic analysis
       application to be programatically used with real-time, continuous
       streams of speech.
     * Trained a classifier to determine mental states based on
       displacements of facial features, and used it in a demo application
       which performed real-time mental state classification.

                                   Experience

   Google Research - Software Engineering Intern Summer 2013
   Working with the Input Methods Research team on mobile text entry.

   Google - Software Engineering Intern Summer 2012
   Designed and implemented a system to detect and provide definitions for
   specialized vocabulary in books, by extracting them from the book text.

   Google - Software Engineering Intern Summer 2011
   Developed a system that predicts how helpful a given user review on the
   Android Marketplace is. In user tests I conducted in several languages,
   the reviews selected by this algorithm were strongly preferred over
   chronological ordering. It has been deployed and is currently being
   used to display reviews on Google Play.

   Microsoft Corporation - Software Development Engineer Intern Summer
   2010
   Implemented the Intellisense API, refactoring options, and Visual
   Studio code completion plugin for a programming language under
   development by the Technical Computing group.

   Google Summer of Code - FFmpeg (Video transcoding library) Summer 2009
   Developed a playlist and concatenation API, parsers for several
   playlist formats, and a transitional interface for existing
   applications, for the FFmpeg video transcoding library.

                                  Open-source
                                    Projects

   UNetbootin (LiveUSB creator) January 2007 - present
   Created UNetbootin, a cross-platform utility to create bootable USB
   flash drives or perform network installations for a wide variety (50+)
   of Linux distributions. This work has been accepted into the official
   package repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Gentoo, and
   other major distributions.
   20 million downloads, http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

   Wubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer) November 2006 - August 2007
   Designed and implemented the early versions of the Windows-based Ubuntu
   Installer, which allows Windows users to safely install Ubuntu Linux
   without repartitioning their hard drives. Formerly an independent
   project, this work is now part of Ubuntu.
   Ships on the official Ubuntu CD, http://wubi.sourceforge.net/

                                    Teaching

   Teaching Assistant - Natural Language Processing (6.863) at MIT Fall
   2012
   Helped write assignments, managed the course infrastructure, and graded
   assignments. I developed new tools to make the assignment grading
   process faster, semi-automatic, and paper-free.

   Instructor - Introduction to C++ IAP (6.096) at MIT January 2011
   Gave lectures, helped write and grade assignments, and helped students
   in lab for a student-run, for-credit introductory C++ course. The
   teaching materials I produced have been made available on
   OpenCourseWare:

   6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011

   Software Director - Maslab Autonomous Robotics Competition at MIT
   January 2011
   As the software director for the competition, I gave the
   software-related lectures, managed the software for the competition,
   and helped students in lab.

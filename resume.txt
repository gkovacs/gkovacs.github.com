                                   Experience

   Google - Software Engineering Intern June - August 2012
   Developed a system to detect specialized vocabulary used in books, and
   provide definitions for them by extracting them from the book text.

   Google - Software Engineering Intern June - August 2011
   Developed a model which would predict how helpful a given user review
   on the Android Marketplace is. In user tests I conducted in several
   languages, the review ordering produced by this algorithm was preferred
   over the existing one, and is thus currently being used on the site.

   Microsoft Corporation - Software Development Engineer Intern June -
   August 2010
   Designed and implemented the Intellisense API, refactoring options, and
   Visual Studio code completion plugin for a new programming language
   which is under development by the Technical Computing group.

                                    Research

   MIT CSAIL - User Interface Design Group September 2011 - present
   Developing a crowd-sourcing system to assist foreign language students
   in vocabulary acquisition while simultaneously generating annotated
   subtitles for videos. (MEng thesis)
   Developed a software internationalization tool which associates the
   translatable strings in an application with screenshots in which they
   appear (using OCR). By presenting a screenshot highlighting how the
   string is being used, this additional context allows translators to
   make more accurate translations.

   MIT Media Lab - Affective Computing Group February - December 2009
   Trained a Bayesian network classifier to determine mental states from a
   still image or from a video stream based on displacements of facial
   features, and used it in a demo application which performed mental
   state classification in real-time from a webcam source. Also created a
   library to allow scripts for the Praat acoustic analysis application to
   be programatically used with real-time, continuous streams of speech.

                                  Open-source
                                    Projects

   UNetbootin (LiveUSB creator) January 2007 - present
   Created UNetbootin, a cross-platform utility to create bootable USB
   flash drives or perform network installations for a wide variety (50+)
   of Linux distributions. This work has been accepted into the official
   package repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Gentoo, and
   other major distributions.
   20 million downloads, http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

   FFmpeg (Video transcoding library) May - August 2009
   Designed and implemented a playlist and concatenation API, parsers for
   several playlist formats, and a transitional interface for existing
   applications, for the FFmpeg audio and video transcoder and library.
   This work was done as part of Google's Summer of Code program.

   Wubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer) November 2006 - August 2007
   Designed and implemented the early versions of the Windows-based Ubuntu
   Installer, which allows Windows users to safely install Ubuntu Linux
   without repartitioning their hard drives. Formerly an independent
   project, this work is now part of Ubuntu.
   Ships on the official Ubuntu CD, http://wubi.sourceforge.net/

                                    Teaching

   Co-Instructor for Introduction to C++ IAP Course at MIT January 2011
   Taught an introductory C++ programming course for MIT students, giving
   lectures, reviewing assignments, and assisting students with software
   labs. Also helped archive the course on MIT's OpenCourseWare site:

                                  Distinctions

   1 $^{\textrm{st}}$ place, CHI 2012 (ACM Conference on Human Factors in
   Computing Systems) Student Research Competition

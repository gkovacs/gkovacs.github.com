<h2>Geza Kovacs</h2>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a senior at MIT, majoring in Computer Science. My research interests are in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and languages - I'm currently focused on building interfaces to assist in translation and language acquisition. I've been doing my research with the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/">User Interface Design group</a> at CSAIL. After graduating this year, I'll be working on my Master's, and I hope to continue on to a PhD after that.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I've done some hacking on open-source projects. If you've ever heard of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, I built the first versions of the Ubuntu installer for Windows, <a href="http://wubi.sourceforge.net/">Wubi</a>. I also built <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">UNetbootin</a>, which is a tool that allows you to make USB drives to install Ubuntu, from Windows.</p>

<p>Being the prolific coder I am, I've also built quite a few random tools, which you can find at <a href="http://github.com/gkovacs">Github</a>, <a href="http://launchpad.net/~gezakovacs">Launchpad</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/u/115256740026582893742/">Google Code</a>.</p>

<p>If you want the details of what I've been working on academia and industry, take a look at my <a href="resume.pdf">resume/CV</a>.</p>

<p>Q: How do I pronounce your name?</p>

<p>A: The "e" sound in Geza is the same as in "hey". The "cs" in Kovacs is pronounced "ch", not "ks".</p>

<p>A: I go by <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=79823">tuxcantfly</a> on the Ubuntu forums and some other open-source software-related sites. My Vietnamese name is Minh Trung, which is written in Chinese characters as 明忠. My Hungarian name is Kovács Géza (Hungarian puts the surname first).</p>

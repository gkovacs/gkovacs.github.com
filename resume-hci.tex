I am the head of \textcolor{sectcol}{Human Computer Interaction} research at Lilt, focusing on \textcolor{sectcol}{Interactive Machine Translation}, \textcolor{sectcol}{Data Science}, \textcolor{sectcol}{UX Research}, and \textcolor{sectcol}{Behavior Change Interventions}. I have a Ph.D in Computer Science from Stanford University, and have been awarded the NSF and NDSEG Fellowships, and a Stanford Human-Centered AI Grant. I have written software used by millions of users -- I built \hypersetup{urlcolor=black}\href{https://habitlab.github.io}{HabitLab}\hypersetup{urlcolor=linkcol}, a data-driven behavior change system with \textcolor{sectcol}{12,000+ daily active users}; I also wrote and maintain \hypersetup{urlcolor=black}\href{https://unetbootin.github.io}{UNetbootin}\hypersetup{urlcolor=linkcol}, an open-source project with \textcolor{sectcol}{40 million downloads}.\\

% I am the head of \textcolor{sectcol}{Human-Computer Interaction} research at Lilt, using \textcolor{sectcol}{Data Science}, \textcolor{sectcol}{Machine Learning}, and \textcolor{sectcol}{Interactive Machine Translation} to boost translator productivity. During my Ph.D at Stanford, I built HabitLab, an app for data-driven behavior change with \textcolor{sectcol}{12,000+ daily active users}. I have published first-author papers in venues including CHI, CSCW, and Learning@Scale, and have reviewed, served on committees, and given invited talks at WMT, EACL, AMTA, CHI, UIST, CSCW, and IMWUT. I have been awarded the NSF and NDSEG Fellowships, and a Stanford Human-Centered AI Grant. I wrote and maintain UNetbootin, an open-source project with \textcolor{sectcol}{40 million downloads}.

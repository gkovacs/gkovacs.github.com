## Geza Kovacs

### About Me

I'm an MEng (Master's of Engineering) student at MIT, majoring in Computer Science. My research interests are in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), social/crowd computing, and languages - I'm currently focused on building interfaces to assist in translation and language acquisition, with focus on utilizing crowd-sourcing and social interactions between users to enhance the experience. I've been doing my research with the [User Interface Design group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/) at CSAIL. After graduating this year, I hope to continue on to a PhD, or go into industrial research.

### Work

I've worked on some open-source projects. If you've ever heard of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), I built the first versions of the Ubuntu installer for Windows, [Wubi](http://wubi.sourceforge.net/). I also built [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), which is a tool that allows you to make USB drives to install Ubuntu, from Windows.

Being the prolific coder I am, I've also built a variety of tools, which you can find at [Github](http://github.com/gkovacs), [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/~gezakovacs), and [Google Code](http://code.google.com/u/115256740026582893742/).

If you want the details of what I've been working on academia and industry, take a look at my [resume/CV](resume.pdf).

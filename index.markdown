## Geza Kovacs

### About Me

I'm a senior at MIT, majoring in Computer Science. My research interests are in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and languages - I'm currently focused on building interfaces to assist in translation and language acquisition. I've been doing my research with the [User Interface Design group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/) at CSAIL. After graduating this year, I'll be working on my Master's, and I hope to continue on to a PhD after that.

### Work

I've done some hacking on open-source projects. If you've ever heard of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), I built the first versions of the Ubuntu installer for Windows, [Wubi](http://wubi.sourceforge.net/). I also built [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), which is a tool that allows you to make USB drives to install Ubuntu, from Windows.

Being the prolific coder I am, I've also built quite a few random tools, which you can find at [Github](http://github.com/gkovacs), [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/~gezakovacs), and [Google Code](http://code.google.com/u/115256740026582893742/). All of this is strictly for personal use, so don't expect anything to be polished at all.

If you want the details of what I've been up to in academia and industry, take a look at my [resume/CV](resume.pdf)

And if you're one of those people really into social networking and your Pokemon gotta-catch-em-all mentality requires you to add someone new to your gargantuan collection of friends, I have a [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/115256740026582893742), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/gkovacs), and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/geza-kovacs/10/189/1).

### FAQ

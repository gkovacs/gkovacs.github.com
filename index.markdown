### About Me

I'm Geza Kovacs. I'm currently a senior at MIT, majoring in Computer Science. Like all CS majors (I hope), I can instantly cook up code in basically any major langauge (as for those I don't know, I've learned quite a few programming languages overnight). My research interests are primarily HCI (Human-Computer Interaction, which can also be referred to as CHI, Computer-Human Interaction, depending on which you think is more important, the human or the computer). Have been doing my research with the [User Interface Design group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/) at CSAIL. Will be MEng-ing next year, and hope to continue on to a PhD after that (doesn't Dr Kovacs sound so cool?).

### Work

I've done some hacking on open-source projects. If you've ever heard of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), I built the first versions of the Ubuntu installer for Windows, [Wubi](http://wubi.sourceforge.net/). I also built [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), which is a tool that allows you to make USB drives to install Ubuntu, from Windows.

Being the prolific coder I am, I've also built quite a few random tools, which you can find at [Github](http://github.com/gkovacs), [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/~gezakovacs), and [Google Code](http://code.google.com/u/115256740026582893742/). All of this is strictly for personal use, so don't expect anything to be polished at all.

If you want the details of what I've been up to in industry, take a look at my [resume/CV](resume.pdf)

And if you're one of those people really into social networking and your Pokemon gotta-catch-em-all mentality requires you to add someone new to your gargantuan collection of "friends", I have a [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/115256740026582893742/posts) and a [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/gkovacs).

### FAQ

Q: Why does this webpage look so ghetto?

A: Because I cranked it out in 10 minutes using Markdown. Remember that bit about learning new programming languages overnight? Yeah, it's my first time using Markdown.

Q: What are your pseudonyms / other names?

A: Used to use tuxcantfly for Linux-related forums and other free-culture-related stuff ([Ubuntu forums](http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=79823) and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tuxcantfly) for example). My Vietnamese name is Minh Trung, for which the corresponding kanji are 明忠. My Hungarian name is Kovács Géza (Hungarian puts the surname first; also note how my official name is missing the accents).
